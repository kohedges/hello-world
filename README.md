Look at me and what do you see
Intelligence beyond compare
But inside I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share
[Brainiacs:]
Open up, dig way down deep
[Martha Cox (spoken):]
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break!
[Braniac (spoken):]
Is that even legal?
[Brainiacs:]
Not another peep
[Martha (spoken):]
It's just dancing. Sometimes I think it's cooler than homework
